title: Building a Retro Blog Interface

I've been working on creating this retro-styled blog interface that mimics the look 
and feel of classic email clients from the Windows 95 era. Here's what I've done:

1. Used the classic Windows 95 color scheme
2. Implemented the characteristic window styling
3. Added familiar UI elements like the menu bar and toolbar
4. Maintained the compact, information-dense layout

The goal was to create a nostalgic yet functional interface that brings back 
memories of the early days of personal computing.
